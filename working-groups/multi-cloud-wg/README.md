# PyTorch Multi-Cloud Working Group

## Overview

The PyTorch multi-cloud working group has been created to develop a sustainable, equitable, community managed approach to the CI/CD pipeline for PyTorch in a multi-cloud environment.

This working group complement the work done by the [PyTorch CI Working Group](../ci-wg/) by focusing on expanding the CI/CD infrastructure to a multi-cloud environment, in a way that is sustainable for the community and for the CI WG.

## Goals

The working group initial list of objectives are:

1. Develop a multi-cloud architecture with cloud-agnostic monitoring and observability.
1. Leverage cloud credits to maintain test coverage without increasing infrastructure spend 
1. Extend the list of node-providers to improve test coverage without increasing infrastructure spend

Once these objectives will be achieved, the group will evaluate whether to continue its activity beyond these initial objectives.

## Outcome

The group will produce the following artifacts and outcomes:

* Solution design and presentation
* Implementation plan
* Staffing and implementation of the solution

As artifacts are produced, they will be stored in this repositories.
Documents will be in the [`docs`](./docs/README.md) folder.
