# PyTorch Foundation Working Groups
A working group (WG) under the Technical Advisory Council (TAC) is a group with a shared interest in advancing a specific area of knowledge, learning, or technology related to the mission of the PyTorch Foundation where members cooperate to affect or to produce solutions within their particular field. A WG can be created by anyone in the PyTorch Foundation community and must be proposed to and approved by the TAC.
