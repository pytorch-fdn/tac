# PyTorch Foundation Working Groups
A working group (WG) under the Technical Advisory Council (TAC) is a group with a shared interest in advancing a specific area of knowledge, learning, or technology related to the mission of the PyTorch Foundation where members cooperate to affect or to produce solutions within their particular field. A WG can be created by anyone in the PyTorch Foundation community and must be proposed to and approved by the TAC.

Working groups are open to the community.  See the specific working group README for instructions on how to join.
