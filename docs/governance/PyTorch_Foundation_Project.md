# PyTorch Foundation-Hosted Project Intake Process

This document outlines the official process for submitting a project to become a Foundation-Hosted Project (Platform or Vertical) under the PyTorch Foundation. The process is governed by the PyTorch Technical Advisory Council (TAC) and aligns with the Foundation-Hosted Project Lifecycle guidelines.

## Introduction

The PyTorch Foundation supports open-source projects that meet high standards of quality, maturity, and community engagement. Foundation-hosted projects benefit from PyTorchâ€™s neutral governance, infrastructure support, visibility, and access to broader AI community collaboration.

To apply, a project must already be an approved PyTorch **Ecosystem Project** and must be sponsored by a **voting TAC member**.

---

## Eligibility Criteria

Projects must meet all the [Foundation-Hosted Project requirements](https://github.com/pytorch-fdn/tac/blob/main/docs/governance/PyTorch_Ecosystem_Process.md), including:

- Compatibility with recent PyTorch releases  
- Strong community, diverse contributors, and active maintenance  
- Clear documentation, quick start, and binary distribution  
- Adoption of an approved governance and licensing model  
- Evidence of production usage  
- Roadmap and strategic alignment with the PyTorch ecosystem  
- Passed a Silver badge on OpenSSF Best Practices

A full checklist is available in the [lifecycle document](https://github.com/pytorch-fdn/tac/blob/main/docs/governance).

## Submission Process

1. **Secure a TAC sponsor** (a voting TAC member who will guide and nominate the project).
2. **Review requirements** with the sponsor to ensure readiness.
3. **Open an issue** in this repository using the Foundation-Hosted Project intake form.
4. **Complete all sections** of the form, including links to documentation, roadmap, license, and CI setup.
5. **Optionally prepare a slide deck**, which may be used during the TAC meeting presentation.

The issue will be added to the [project board](#) for triage and scheduling.

---

## Review and Evaluation

- The PyTorch Foundation staff and TAC sponsor will assist the project team in preparing for review.
- The project will be scheduled for an upcoming TAC meeting.
- The project team will present the case for inclusion as a Platform or Vertical project.
- TAC members and the broader community may ask questions or request clarifications through the issue thread.

---

## Voting

- Voting takes place during a scheduled TAC meeting.
- **A 2/3 majority vote by the TAC is required** for a project to be accepted.
- If approved:
  - The project is classified as **Platform** or **Vertical**
  - It gains access to all Foundation-hosted project benefits
  - The contribution process will be completed with LF Legal
- If declined:
  - The TAC will provide feedback
  - The project remains an Ecosystem project unless offboarded

---

## Reapplication

Projects not approved may reapply after **a minimum of 3 months**, provided tangible progress has been made on the feedback shared during review.

---

## Onboarding

Upon approval:

- LF Legal will finalize contribution and asset transfer
- Foundation staff will support onboarding and access to benefits
- Project branding, website, marketing, and CI setup will be coordinated

---

## Project Status and Offboarding

Projects may later enter a **Retired** status based on inactivity or failure to meet ongoing requirements. The TAC reviews all projects annually and may initiate the retirement process if needed.
