## Working Groups
* A working group (WG) under the Technical Advisory Council (TAC) is a group with a shared interest in advancing a specific area of knowledge, learning, or technology related to the mission of the PyTorch Foundation where members cooperate to affect or to produce solutions within a specific area. The TAC supports multiple technical working groups.
